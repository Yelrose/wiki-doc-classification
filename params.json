  "body": "### Introduction\r\n\r\nIn machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract \"topics\" that occur in a collection of documents. We tried to use different kinds of models and study their behaviour to understand the differences in various kinds of topic models, their advantages and their disadvantages while also learning about advances in this field in the last couple of years.\r\n\r\n### Dataset\r\n\r\nWe extracted articles from [Wiki10+](http://nlp.uned.es/social-tagging/wiki10+/) using bleach and couple of handcrafted regexs.\r\n\r\n### Methods Used\r\n\r\n## TF - IDF\r\n\r\nMarkdown has two types of links: inline and reference. For both types of links, the text you want to display to the user is placed in square brackets. For example, if you want your link to display the text “GitHub”, you write.\r\n\r\n## LDA\r\n\r\nMarkdown has two types of links: inline and reference.
